# hello-world
This is my first repository on GitHub.  Hopefully, after this is finished, I can move on to more interesting projects.

I do research for the C.I.A.  People often laugh when I tell them this and usually ask if I will have to kill them, now they know who I am.  I always tell them I don't work for the government, but the Culinary Institute of America.  I can cook.
